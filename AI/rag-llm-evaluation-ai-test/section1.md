# RAG-LLM Evaluation & Test Automation with RAGAS Pytest Framework

**What will you learn from the course?**

* High-level overview of Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Understanding how custom LLMs are built using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
* Common benchmarks and evaluation metrics for assessing RAG-based LLMs.
* Introduction to the RAGAS evaluation framework for testing and validating LLMs.
* Writing practical scripts to automate and assert the metric scores of LLMs.
* Automating scenarios such as single-turn and multi-turn interactions with LLMs using the RAGAS framework.
* Generating test data for evaluating LLM metrics using the RAGAS framework.

> We call as LLM Evaluation than as Testing  
We can't put a direct assertion for LLMs

RAGAS is a Library

```

Now every company is coming up with their own custom LLMs  
They take a base model like and they build a wrapper around it.  

## Course Outcome

* By the end of the course, you will be able to create a **RAGAS Pytest Evaluation Framework** to assert the metrics of RAG-based (custom) LLMs

## Key Metrics

This course covers **7 key evaluation metrics** commonly used to test LLMs. The same approach can be applied to other metric evaluations

## Hands-on Experience

The course provides a **practice RAG-LLM** for hands-on  
learning. However, during the scripting phase, **a basic OpenAI subscription** is required to access APIs (**a minimal $10 credit will suffice)**

## Course Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of **Python and Pytest** is required. The  
course includes **two dedicated sections** at the end,  
covering the essential Python & Pytest concepts needed. A  
basic understanding of **API testing** is also recommended.

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Definition: AI is the branch of computer science that creates systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, decision-making, and
problem-solving.

## What are Large Language Models(LLMs)?

**Definition**

LLMs are advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text
data to understand, generate, and interact with natural language using deep learning techniques, particularly transformers.

## How LLMs Work

* Pre-Training - Trained on diverse datasets (books, articles, code, etc.) to predict the next word in a sentence.

Example - Given "The capital of Italy is" the model predicts "Rome".

* Fine-Tuning - Refined for specific tasks like customer support or medical diagnosis.

* Inference - Generates responses to user queries using pre-trained knowledge.

## Top 5 LLMs - One liner summaries

1. GPT-4(OpenAI) - Versatile model excelling in multitasking, reasoning, and conversational AI

2. Gemini(Google) - Next-gen AI with advanced reasoning and multi-modal capabilities

3. Claude (Anthropic) - Safety-focused conversational model optimized for ethical AI.

4. GitHub Copilot(OpenAI Codex) - AI assistant for coding, aiding in writing and debugging.

5. Perplexity AI - Combines retrieval-augumented generation with conversational AI for fact-based responses

## LLMs Challenges

1. **Outdated Knowledge**: Pre-trained LLMs may lack recent or domain-specific information (e.g..
company policies. FAQs).
2. **Data Privacy**: LLMs cannot inherently verify or access private/secure documents.
3. **Hallucination**: LLMs can generate fabricated or inaccurate information.
